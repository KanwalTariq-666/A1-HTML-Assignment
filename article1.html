        <h3>Scholarly Sources</h3>
        <p>by Ed McCarthy</p>

        <p>For many research assignments, finding and reading scholarly (or academic) sources is a requirement of the assignment. Scholarly sources can include any books or journal articles written by academic researchers for the academic community. They reflect the high research standards and values of the academic community, including using well established research methods, citing sources, maintaining objectivity, collecting data ethically, and more. Whenever possible, choose a scholarly source.</p>

        <p>You may be wondering...</p>

        <p>What's the difference between scholarly, academic, or peer-reviewed?</p>

        <p>You may be asked to find “scholarly” / “academic” / “research” / “peer reviewed” articles for an assignment. These terms are often used interchangeably, but there are some key differences.</p>

        <h3>Scholarly (Academic) Sources</h3>
    
        <p>Scholarly sources, sometimes called academic sources, are written by academics and other experts to share research findings, theories, analyses, ideas, or summaries of knowledge. Scholarly sources may be primary or secondary sources.
    
        Scholarly sources are most often associated with articles from scholarly journals. However, books published by academic publishers, such as University of Toronto Press or Oxford University Press, may also be considered scholarly. </p>
    
        <h3>Peer Reviewed Articles</h3>
    
        <p>Peer reviewed articles refer to scholarly articles that have been 'peer reviewed'. Peer-review is a rigorous editorial process implemented by many scholarly journals. The peer review process involves the evaluation and critical appraisal of an article or manuscript by a reviewer(s) who is also a researcher in that field of study. The article may be reviewed by multiple experts who read the article and then assess the content to ensure the document meets a high level of scholarship. Watch What is a Peer-Review? (2:37).
    
        As shown in the illustration, all peer-reviewed sources are scholarly. However, not all scholarly sources are peer-reviewed. To find out if an article has been peer-reviewed, look up the journal homepage and look for a description of the journal.</p>
    
        <h3>Research Articles</h3>

        <p>Research articles refer to a type of scholarly article where a researcher, or group of researchers, present findings of their original research, usually involving surveys, interviews, or the like. These articles may also be peer-reviewed.
